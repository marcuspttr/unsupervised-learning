# unsupervised-learning
Using unsupervised machine learning methods to help cluster cryptocurrencies.

## Some thoughts:
This was an interesting assignment.  We had previously done the calculations, so it was nice to call this work back and create both interesting visualizations but also a space to view them.

## Final thoughts:
I'm very happy with the map's final appearance. Ran out of time to attempt the bonus, but I liked how it came out.
